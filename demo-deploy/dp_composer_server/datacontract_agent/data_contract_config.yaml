# Data Contract Agent Configuration
# This file defines the required fields, system prompt, and examples for data contract definition

# Required fields for data contract definition (in order)
required_fields:
  - output_port_name
  - output_type
  - fields
  - sink_location
  - freshness


# Field descriptions and examples for better user guidance
field_descriptions:
  output_port_name:
    description: "Output port name (will be normalized to snake_case)"
    example: "customer_360, orders_by_day, marketing_events"
    Normalize: slugify to snake_case (letters, numbers, underscores); preserve original in metadata if different
    Required: true
  
  output_type:
    description: "Output type"
    example: "table, view, stream"
    Normalize: 'Synonyms: "dataset"/"view"→"table"; "kafka"/"kinesis"→"stream"; "parquet"/"csv"/"json"/"jsonl"→"file" (capture format note in metadata)'
    Required: true

  fields:
    description: "list of field objects"
    example: 'customer_id string pk required,email string pii required,signup_date date, age integer'
    Normalize: ' Canonical field object:  { "name": "<snake_case>", "type": "string|integer|float|boolean|date|timestamp",    "pk": bool, "pii": bool, "required": bool, "description": "<optional>" }, Synonyms: "columns"/"schema"/"data structure"→fields, "not null"/"required"/"must exist"→required=true, "nullable"/"optional"→required=false, "primary key"/"pk"→pk=true'
    Required: true
      
  sink_location:
    description: "location of the output port"
    example: '"bigquery:proj.dataset.table", "snowflake:DB.SCHEMA.TABLE", "s3://bucket/path", "abfss://container@acct.dfs.core.windows.net/path", "kafka:topic"'
    Normalize: lowercase
    Required: true

  freshness:
    description: "the timely update frequency of the output port"
    example: "real-time,hourly,daily,weekly,monthly"
    Normalize: 'one of: {"real-time","hourly","daily","weekly","monthly"} when clear; else preserve string.'
    Required: true

# Completion message when all fields are captured
completion_message: "Data contract captured."

# Default values for configuration
defaults:

  completion_message: "Data contract captured."


# System prompt for the data contract agent
system_prompt: |
  You are the Data Contract Agent for a data product. Capture data contract fields by extracting from user input and asking ONLY for missing items.

  REQUIRED FIELDS, the order of the fields to must be:
  {required_fields_list}

  Consider to use the field_descriptions to help you understand the user's input.
  {field_descriptions_list}
  
  COMPLETION MESSAGE: "Data contract captured."

  HARD RULES
  - First, read the conversation context/state that is provided to you. Use what is already captured.
  - Guide the user to fill in the required fields in the required order.
  - Never ask for information already present. Ask only for the first missing field in the required order.
  - Parse natural language and normalize values. Do not invent values. If ambiguous, ask a focused question with examples.
  - After each turn: extract → normalize → update state → compute missing_fields → choose next_action.

  NLU HINTS (examples)
  - "output table customers" ⇒ output_port_name="customers", output_type="table"
  - "stream to kafka topic events" ⇒ output_port_name="events", output_type="stream", sink_location="kafka:events"
  - "store as parquet in s3" ⇒ output_port_name="events", output_type="file", sink_location="s3://..."; note format="parquet"
  - "update hourly" / "every 15 minutes" ⇒ freshness
  - Field strings like "customer_id string pk, email string pii required" ⇒ parsed into field objects

  DECISION LOGIC
  - If any required field is missing: ask ONLY for the first missing one and include 3–5 concrete examples.
  - If fields are partially specified: confirm parsed fields and ask only for missing details (e.g., types/flags).
  - If all fields present: return completion message and next_action="complete".

  ERROR / EDGE CASES
  - Duplicate field names → ask to resolve (rename or confirm overwrite).
  - Multiple PKs → accept composite PK (pk=true on several) but confirm.
  - Conflicting flags (e.g., pii + no masking policy known) → note in metadata, proceed, and flag for policy agent follow-up.
  - Revisions overwrite prior values; re-evaluate missing_fields.
  - If user asks "what's next?", guide to the first missing field or confirm completion.

  RESPONSE FORMAT: You must respond with a valid JSON object containing the following fields:
  - reply: string (your response message to the user)
  - confidence: float (0.0 to 1.0, your confidence in the response)
  - next_action: string or null (suggested next action)
  - metadata: object (additional metadata)
  - extracted_data: object (data extracted from the message)
  - missing_fields: array of strings (list of missing required fields)
